<h1 ><u> Idea Used: </u></h1>

## In a given range of numbers from (l-r) inclusive, it's sure that each pair of consecutive numbers will have a gcd of 1. So it's already given that there will be even range. So it's possible to make pairs having all numbers in that set which are consecutive. e.g: l=1, r=8: {1,2},{3,4}....

## So the answer will always be a YES.
